# angular-basic-autocomplete
AngularJS Directive only Autocomplete input box.

I couldn't find any basic examples of an AngularJS autocomplete input box so I decided to roll my own. The current state is is a very buggy proof of concept.

If you have found this feel free to have fun with it but know it isn't production ready. You will have to do a lot of cleanup until I have a chance to update the code.

- This one like others out there uses Bootstrap.
- No controllers.
- As basic as possible.
